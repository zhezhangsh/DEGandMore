\title{
A wrapper function for two-group differential gene expression.
}
\description{
This wrapper function provides a common interface to all available methods that performs analysis of diffferential gene expression between two sample groups. It takes a matrix of transcriptome data generated by microarray or RNA-seq, and uses specified method to calculate a p value for each gene. 
}
\usage{
DeWrapper(mtrx, grps, mthd, paired=FALSE, logged=TRUE, args=list());

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{mtrx}{The numeric matrix of a transcriptome data set. Each row is a gene and each column is a sample. Some DE methods require the matrix to be normalized between samples. }
  \item{grps}{A list of 2 elements, named by the names of the two groups to be compared. Both vectors should include the sample IDs of the compared groups, that match the column names of the <mtrx> parameter. The first element should be the reference/control/untreated/wildtype/... group. Samples must be sorted in matching order for paired test.}
  \item{mthd}{The name of the DE method to be used for differential expression analysis. Call DeMethods() to get names of all available DE methods.}
  \item{paired}{Whether the samples of the compared groups are paired. It will be ignored if the chosen DE method doesn't support paired test}
  \item{logged}{Whether a log-transformation has been applied to the data set. If the DE method require}
