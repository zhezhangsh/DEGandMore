parameter: 
  min.n: 4.0        ## Minimal number of samples in each group for outlier detection
  max.corr: 0.995    ## Maximal mean correlation coefficient for a sample to be outlier
  n.sd: 3.0         ## Number of standard deviations less than the mean of correlation coefficients of non-outlier samples
  cut.corr: 0.5     ## Cutoff of correlation coefficent of outlier/non-outlier differential expression between a pair of outliers to determin they had similar quality issue
  deg:              #  Criteria to select outlier/non-outlier DEGs
    de: 2.0         ## Minimal difference between outlier and the mean of non-outliers
    nsd: 3.0        ## Minimal number of standard deviations
    min: 50.0       ## Minimal number of DEGs to be selected (the nsd requirement must also be met, so the final number could be smaller)
    max: 250.0      ## Maximal number of DEGs to be selected
