  Title: Response of juvenile mice to spinal cord injury ## Project title
  Description: This project uses gene expression microarray data to track transcriptome
    of young mice after spinal cord injury. Measurements were made in control and
    5 time points after injury from 6 hours to 2 weeks. The goal of this analysis
    is to identify gene clusters that were signficantly different across time points. ## Full description
methods: # Data processing and analysis methods
input: # Location of input files
  data: /nas/is1/zhangz/projects/barr/2015-11_Rat_Brain_Development/r/Juvenile_SC_injury/expr18_rescaled.rds ## a matrix of data, row=gene, column=sample 
    # The order of the samples in the matrix matters, order them based on the order of the groups
    # It's preferrable to rescale the data matrix to make the mean and SD of each row 0 and 1.0 respectively
    # No missing values allowed, remove rows with missing values or run imputation if estimate missing values
  annotation: /nas/is1/zhangz/projects/barr/2015-11_Rat_Brain_Development/r/Juvenile_SC_injury/anno.rds ## a data frame of gene annotation, match row names
  sample: /nas/is1/zhangz/projects/barr/2015-11_Rat_Brain_Development/r/Juvenile_SC_injury/smpl18.rds ## a data frame of sample manifest
  geneset: /nas/is1/rchive/data/gene.set/r/default_set_rat_5-1000.rds ## a list of 2 members, the first is metadata of gene sets, the second is a list of gene set-gene mapping
  subtemplate: ~/R/source/DEGandMore/examples/MultiGroupCluster/ClDetail.Rmd ## the location of template file for analyzing individual clusters
  remote: no ## whether the templates are located remotely (as URL) or locally (as file name)
parameter: # All parameters
  term: Group ## Corresponding to a column name in sample; based on which samples will be grouped
  selection: ## How significant genes will be selected as seeds for initiating clusters
    min: 500 ### Minimal number of genes for further selection (no further selection if number is lower than it)
    max: 2000 ### Maximum number of genes to be selected
    fdr: 0.2 ### First selection criteria, maximum FDR value (ANOVA p value adjusted by BH method)
    p: 0.01 ### Second selection criteria, maximum ANOVA p value
    range: 2.0 ### Third selection criteria, the difference of max and min values
  cluster: ## How initial clusters will be generated
    height: 1.6 ### The height to cut clustering tree. Lower value generates more clusters
    size: 0.2 ### The minimum size of a cluster (relative ratio to expected size)
    corr: 0.6 ### The minimum correlation coefficient to the cluster centroid for a gene to be kept in the cluster
    merge: ### How to merge similar clusters
      corr: 0.5 #### The minimum correlation coefficient between 2 centroids to merge two clusters
      p: 0.05 #### The maximum p value between 2 centroids to merge two clusters
  recluster: ## How to refine clusters via reclustering cycles
    p: 0.02 ### Maximum ANOVA p value to include a gene
    r: 0.6 ### Minimum correlation coefficient between a gene and centroid to inlude a gene in the cluster
    diff: 0.2 ### Minimum correlation coefficient difference between and best and the second best
    times: 20.0 ### Number of reclustering cycles
  plot: ## How to plot results
    rescale: no ### whether to rescale data matrix
    zero: yes ### whether to use the first group as background and set its mean to 0 for all genes
    ylab: Average expression (# of SD)  ### y-axis label in plots
