  title: Response of juvenile mice to spinal cord injury
  description: This project uses gene expression microarray data to track transcriptome
    of young mice after spinal cord injury. Measurements were made in control and
    5 time points after injury from 6 hours to 2 weeks. The goal of this analysis
    is to identify gene clusters that were signficantly different across time points.
