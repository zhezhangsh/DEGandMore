  Description: The project studies effect of LPS on 3 mouse tissues; uterus of mother mice, placenta of newborns and liver of newborns. Additionally, newborns were separated by genders.   # Full description
  Analysis: This analysis is interested in the gender difference in terms of response to LPS in infant mouse livers.                                                                        # This analysis
