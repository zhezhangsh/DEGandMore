project: # Project background
  Title: Treatment of pregnant mice with LPS ## Project title
  Home: http://mybic.chop.edu/labs/Rebecca_Simmons_Lab/Infant_mouse_LPS ## Project home page
  Description: The project studies effect of LPS on 3 mouse tissues; uterus of mother mice, placenta of newborns and liver of newborns. Additionally, newborns were separated by genders. ## Full description
  Analysis: This analysis is interested in the gender difference in terms of response to LPS in infant mouse livers.
